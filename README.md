# Wheel-Propeller-Mechanism-Testing
MATLAB simulation for amphibious wheel-propeller design with hydrofoil spokes (NACA 0015). Analyzes hydrodynamic performance (thrust, torque, lift) and structural integrity (stress, safety factors) for underwater cycloidal propulsion. Supports multiple materials (PLA, CF-Nylon, Aluminum). Generates 3D stress maps and performance plots.
