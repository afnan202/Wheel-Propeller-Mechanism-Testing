# Wheel-Propeller-Mechanism-Testing
MATLAB simulation for amphibious wheel-propeller design with hydrofoil spokes (NACA 0015). Analyzes hydrodynamic performance (thrust, torque, lift) and structural integrity (stress, safety factors) for underwater cycloidal propulsion. Supports multiple materials (PLA, CF-Nylon, Aluminum). Generates 3D stress maps and performance plots.

This MATLAB repository provides comprehensive simulation and structural analysis tools for designing amphibious wheel-propeller systems with integrated hydrofoil spokes. The system functions as a conventional wheel on land and transforms into a cycloidal propeller underwater, enabling seamless amphibious vehicle operation.
